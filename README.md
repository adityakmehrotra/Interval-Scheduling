# Interval-Scheduling
Solving the Interval Scheduling problem optimally, as well as solving the Weighted Interval Scheduling problem optimally in time and space.

## Non-Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem
### Problem Input Description
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a pair of
positive integers i and j, where i < j, and i is the start time, and j is the end time.
### Problem Output Description
For each instance, the program should output the number of intervals scheduled on a separate line.
Each output line should be terminated by a newline
